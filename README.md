## FAQ

1. Is it safe to add [Visiting Tales](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/6899) mid-save? <br>
It is! While there are questions that only available based on certain conditions (like [potential marriage question](Documentation/Themed/PotentialMarriage)), you will still see most content added just fine.
2. Is this mod is compatible with that mod? <br>
Most likely they are. I can't say for sure though. You are free to try and report the finding. It will surely be helpful to others.
